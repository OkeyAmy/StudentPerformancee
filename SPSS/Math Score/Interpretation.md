## Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics table provides information on three variables: mathscore, readingscore, and writingscore. Here are some observations based on the statistics:

- Range: The range of math scores is 100, reading score is 83, and writing score is 90. This indicates that math scores vary more widely compared to the other two.
- Mean: The mean math score is 66.09, reading score is 69.17, and writing score is 68.05. This indicates that the average math score is lower than the other two scores.
- Std. Deviation: The standard deviation of math scores is the highest (15.163), indicating greater variability in math scores compared to the others.
- Kurtosis and Skewness: All scores have a negative skewness value, indicating a slightly left-skewed distribution. The kurtosis of math score is positive, suggesting a slightly peaked distribution.

Overall, the data suggests some variability in scores across the three subjects, with math scores having a wider range and greater variability compared to reading and writing scores.
