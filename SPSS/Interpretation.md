## Descriptive Statistics

The descriptive statistics table provides information on three variables: mathscore, readingscore, and writingscore. Here are some observations based on the statistics:

- Range: The range of math scores is 100, the reading score is 83, and the writing score is 90. This indicates that math scores vary more widely compared to the other two.
- Mean: The mean math score is 66.09, reading score is 69.17, and writing score is 68.05. This indicates that the average math score is lower than the other two scores.
- Std. Deviation: The standard deviation of math scores is the highest (15.163), indicating greater variability in math scores compared to the others.
- Kurtosis and Skewness: All scores have a negative skewness value, indicating a slightly left-skewed distribution. The kurtosis of math score is positive, suggesting a slightly peaked distribution.

Overall, the data suggests some variability in scores across the three subjects, with math scores having a wider range and greater variability compared to reading and writing scores.

## Categorical Variable Visualization

I performed a bar chart visualization on several categorical variables. Here are the conclusions based on the visualization:

- Gender: The majority of students who took the test are females.

- Ethnicity: The visualization shows that the majority of students belong to Group C, while Group A has the least representation.

- Parental Level of Education: The majority of students have a parental level of education of "some college," while a "master's degree" has the least representation.

- Lunch: The visualization indicates that the majority of students who took the test have a standard lunch.

- Test Preparation: The visualization reveals that the majority of students did not have any test preparation.


## Correlation Analysis on the Dependent Variable

The correlation analysis reveals strong positive correlations between reading scores, math scores, and writing scores. The Pearson correlation matrix and the Nonparametric Correlations indicate a significant positive relationship among the scores. This suggests that the others also tend to increase as one of these scores increases.
