**The Student Performance contains information on students' demographics, test preparation, and scores in math, reading, and writing.**

*We are expected to perform this analysis:*

* Identifying the factors that affect students' performance in math, reading, and writing
* Comparing the performance of different groups of students based on their gender, race/ethnicity, parental level of education, and lunch status
* Analyzing the impact of test preparation courses on students' performance
* Building predictive models to forecast students' scores based on their demographic information and test preparation status
